Description: For one-way layout experiments the one-way ANOVA can
	     be performed as an omnibus test. All-pairs multiple comparisons 
	     tests (Tukey-Kramer test, Scheffe test, LSD-test) 
	     and many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for normally distributed 
	     residuals and equal within variance are available. Furthermore,
	     all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test, 
	     Dunnett T3 test, Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one
	     (Tamhane-Dunnett Test) for normally distributed residuals 
	     and heterogeneous variances are provided. Van der Waerden's normal
	     scores test for omnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one tests is
	     provided for non-normally distributed residuals and homogeneous
	     variances. The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS and Anderson-Darling
	     omnibus test and all-pairs tests
	     (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, Conover test, Dwass-Steele-Critchlow-
	     Fligner test) as well as many-to-one (Nemenyi test, Dunn test,
	     U-test) are given for the analysis of variance by ranks. 
             Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere test, Cuzick test,
	     Johnson-Mehrotra test, Spearman test) are included. 
	     In addition, a Friedman-test for one-way ANOVA with repeated 
	     measures on ranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack test for unbalanced 
	     CRBD is provided with consequent all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, 
	     Siegel test, Miller test, Conover test, Exact test)
	     and many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar test, Exact test). 
	     A trend can be tested with Pages's test. Durbin's test 
	     for a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is given 
	     in this package as well as Gore's test for CRBD with multiple
	     observations per cell is given.  Outlier tests, Mandel's k- and
	     h statistic as well as functions for Type I error and Power 
	     analysis as well as generic summary, print and plot methods 
             are provided.
